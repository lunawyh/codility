for the while - else, the else is dependent on wheater the while loop finishs normally (without a break).
If the while loop runs fully, then else will run. If a break was activated in while, else will not run

def solution(A, B):
    stack = []  # Stack to store surviving fish
    for i in range(len(A)):
        # Process the current fish
        while stack and B[i] == 0 and stack[-1][1] == 1:
            # Fight between the upstream fish and downstream fish in the stack
            if A[i] > stack[-1][0]:
                stack.pop()  # Upstream fish wins
            else:
                break  # Downstream fish wins, stop the fight
        
        else:
            # Add the current fish to the stack if no fight or it survives
            stack.append([A[i], B[i]])
    
    return len(stack)
